# Grade Calculator
# Problem: Assign a letter grade based on a student's score: 
# A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60)

# grade = int(input("Enter your grades"))

# if grade >100:
#     print("invalid")
# elif  90 <=grade <= 100:
#     print("Your grade is A")
# elif 80 <=grade<= 89:
#     print("Your grade is B")
# elif 70 <=grade<= 79:
#     print("Your grade is C")
# elif 60 <=grade<= 69:
#     print("Your grade is D")
# else:
#     print("You are fail, F")


# Problem: Determine if a year is a leap year. 
# (Leap years are divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400)
